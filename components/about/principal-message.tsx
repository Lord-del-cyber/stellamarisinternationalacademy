            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Welcome to Stella Maris International Academy. As Principal, I am proud to lead an institution that has
              consistently demonstrated excellence in education and character development.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Our mission is to nurture young minds not just academically, but to develop them into responsible,
              compassionate global citizens. We believe that education extends beyond the classroomâ€”it encompasses the
              development of critical thinking, creativity, and moral values.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Every student at Stella Maris is encouraged to discover their unique potential and contribute meaningfully
              to society. We are committed to providing an environment where excellence is pursued, innovation is
              celebrated, and every individual is valued.
            </p>
            <p className="text-primary font-heading font-bold">Together, we are building leaders for tomorrow.</p>
